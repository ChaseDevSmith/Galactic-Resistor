        <p>Welcome to Galactic Resistor, there is a big evil in the galaxy and your mission is to carry the last bomb strong enough to wipe out this evil entity. Emphasis on the last bomb capable of doing the job. You are the galaxy's last hope. Avoid being caught before reaching big boss.
             Win the game by crashing your ship into the big boss on level 3. If you die before making it to the final boss, the galaxy is doomed!</p>
